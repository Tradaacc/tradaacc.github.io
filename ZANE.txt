Hey Zane I'm leaving some notes here for you to access whenever you need to.


I found out how the .scss files work. It's like an advanced .css file that can handle functions, inheritence,
etc. I watched a video over it on youtube that was really beneficial that lasted about 20 minutes. I highly
recommend you watch it as reference. The URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6eOVaaelI. (The guy's
dialect is a little annoying but it's only 20 min so...). I think that the combination of sass and bootstrap
could easily make our website end up looking really professional on all devices.

I think I got an idea for the first application we could develop for PC. I have found multiple different types
and styles of todo lists, but some have certain functionality that others don't and I have failed to locate
one that has all the tools that I would like it to have. I thought it might be a cool idea to design a 
productivity application that could do all of the above. Tell me if you like the idea and I'll set up a repo
for it in github.
